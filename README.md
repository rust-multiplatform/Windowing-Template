# Rust Multi-Platform: Base Project Template

[![Multiplatform Build](https://github.com/Sakul6499/Rust-Multi-Platform-Project-Template/actions/workflows/multiplatform-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Sakul6499/Rust-Multi-Platform-Project-Template/actions/workflows/multiplatform-build.yml)

This repository is a template.
It's main purpose is to make it easier to get started with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for multiple platforms.

This project is supported by the following platforms:

- ✅ Platform: Windows
- ✅ Platform: Linux
- ✅ Platform: macOS
- ✅ Platform: Android
- ✅ Platform: iOS
- ✅ Platform: WebAssembly

To use this template simply fork it (button in top right corner) into your own namespace.
If you need some more advanced setup check out the [forking guide](FORKING.md).
We also include a checklist for [what to do after forking](FORKING.md#what-is-important-to-do-after-forking).

## Licenses

This project is dual licensed in Rust's fashion:

- [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)
- [Apache License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html)

For your own project you can chose whichever fits you better.
For templates/examples we recommend to also dual-licensing.

| ./                                             | Workspace root; `Cargo.toml` contains all project folders (internal crates)                                                         |  |
| [platform/](platform/)                         | Platform projects root. Contains every platform this demonstration is supported on incl. instructions on how to build and use them. |
| [platform/android/](platform/android/)         | Contains the Android platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Android and run it.                         |
| [platform/ios/](platform/ios/)                 | Contains the iOS platform project and instructions on how to build this project for iOS and run it.                                 |
| [platform/linux/](platform/linux/)             | Contains the Linux platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Linux and run it.                             |
| [platform/macos/](platform/macos/)             | Contains the macOS platform project and instructions on how to build this project for macOS and run it.                             |
| [platform/windows/](platform/windows/)         | Contains the Windows platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Windows and run it.                         |
| [platform/webassembly/](platform/webassembly/) | Contains the WebAssembly platform project and instructions on how to build this project for Websites and run it.                    |
| [shared/](shared/)                             | Contains the **shared** code between **all** projects.                                                                              |

To break this down:
The [shared/](shared/) folder contains our **cross/multi-platform code**.
99.9% of what we do in this project will happen there.

Each of the projects inside [platform/](platform/) are representing a **platform specific project**.
In most cases, like for Windows, Linux and macOS, there is nothing else to do but call our shared code and compile a **binary**.
However, on certain platforms, like Android and iOS, we have to use some special commands and tools to get an e.g. .APK (Android) or .APP (iOS) file.
Furthermore, on those systems resources/assets may need to be specially loaded and their `Cargo.toml` will be much more extensive.
Simply said: For those special platforms we will use some cargo extensions which will automatically generate a native project in the background. Values from `Cargo.toml` will be used to generate those.

**Please check the `README.md` inside each platform to see how each platform is build, run and what you will need to do so.**

## Targets & Architectures

This project is aiming to work across all platforms **and targets**.
All **Tier 1** targets are tested in CI's of this repository.
Additionally, _some_ **Tier 2** targets are tested.

However, this should work on all targets. If you find an issue please report it.

## Building & Running

**Building & Running all projects at once only works if your host platform has all required packages installed.**
**Unfortunately, do to Apple's restrictions, macOS and iOS platforms can _only_ be build on macOS.**
**This also means that macOS is the only host platform that can build _all_ platforms at once.**

However, we can build and run individual parts (`packages`) matching our host platform and we can use a combination of cross-compilation, Docker and/or Virtual Machines (VM) to build everything on one host platform.

✅ = Natively supported.
🔀 = Cross-Compilation & Toolchain needed.
⚠️ = Possible, but takes some more effort and/or special setups or VM to work.

Building can be done via:

```shell
cargo build --package <package>
```

Or run it directly (running will build the project beforehand!):

```shell
cargo run --package <package>
```

If there are tests present for the project, we can test them:

```shell
cargo test --package <package>
```

Or check if the project configuration is valid & build-able:

```shell
cargo check --package <package>
```

> Note: Adding `--release` to either of the commands will build a release version, instead of a debug version.

**Do note that some platforms (like iOS and Android) require special tools and `cargo` extensions to properly build.**
While we could do that step manually, it is much more convenient and easier to use this way.
Check the `README.md` of a platform to learn more about requirements and tools.

Since we can't build for all target platforms on a single host platform (without major modification; see above), the `--package <package>` part is very important.
Simply replace `<package>` with the package name inside the `Cargo.toml` to build it.
Names commonly will be `platform_<platform>` for platform-specific packages (e.g. `platform_windows` or `platform_ios`) or `shared` for the shared code.
In case multiple shared projects are present, check their `Cargo.toml` for their name (commonly: folder name).

However, since we share most of our code on all target platforms, we only really need to validate the code working on **one platform** (ideally your host platform for best performance or main target platform).
Only rarely should we need platform-specific code which, if it exists, needs to be tested.
Though, a continuous integration pipeline (CI) can take care of that for you mostly!
Check [Continuous Integration](#Continuous-Integration) for more.

## Continuous Integration

[![Multiplatform Build](https://github.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/actions/workflows/multiplatform-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/actions/workflows/multiplatform-build.yml)

This project utilizes the GitHub Actions CI (= Continuous Integration) to showcase how to build for all platforms.
For most platforms we just need a runner on the target platform (Windows, Linux or macOS) and install Rust.
This can be simply done by following [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) (check the [other install options](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html) for automatically installing inside an CI).
Something like:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable --profile full -y
```

should work for most platforms.

Note that we _may_ need more tools installed depending on the CI provider and platform.
Check the host <-> target matrix at [Building & Running](#Building-&-Running)

Additionally, often we have to `source` the profile changes. Something like:

```shell
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Coverage

A combination of [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) and [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) is used to provide code-to-test coverage.  
**Please note that it is impossible to reach 100% coverage on some platforms as e.g. bindgen-code (i.e. dynamically generated code / macros) is NOT covered by `grcov` and certain platform specific tools (like `cargo-apk`) generate additional code that also is NOT included in the coverage.**
