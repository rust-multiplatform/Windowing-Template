> Note that some pipelines don't cover all platforms/projects, but are building a specific project like `platform_linux`.

To break this down:  
The [shared/](shared/) folder contains our **cross/multi-platform code**.  
99.9% of what we do in this project will happen there.

Each of the projects inside [platform/](platform/) are representing a **platform specific project**.  
In most cases, like for Windows, Linux and macOS, there is nothing else to do but call our shared code and compile a **binary**.  
However, on certain platforms, like Android and iOS, we have to use some special commands and tools to get an e.g. .APK (Android) or .APP (iOS) file.
Furthermore, on those systems resources/assets may need to be specially loaded and their `Cargo.toml` will be much more extensive.
Simply said: For those special platforms we will use some cargo extensions which will automatically generate a native project in the background. Values from `Cargo.toml` will be used to generate those.

**Please check the `README.md` inside each platform to see how each platform is build, run and what you will need to do so.**

## Targets & Architectures

This project is aiming to work across all platforms **and targets**.  
All **Tier 1** targets are tested in CI's of this repository.  
Additionally, _some_ **Tier 2** targets are tested.

However, this should work on all targets. If you find an issue please report it.

## Building & Running

**Building & Running all projects at once only works if your host platform has all required packages installed.**  
**Unfortunately, do to Apple's restrictions, macOS and iOS platforms can _only_ be build on macOS.**  
**This also means that macOS is the only host platform that can build _all_ platforms at once.**

However, we can build and run individual parts (`packages`) matching our host platform and we can use a combination of cross-compilation, Docker and/or Virtual Machines (VM) to build everything on one host platform.

Host (top) vs. Target (left) compatibility matrix:  

|                     | Host: Windows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Host: Linux                                                                                                                                                                     | Host: macOS                                                                                                                                    |

✅ = Natively supported.  
🔀 = Cross-Compilation & Toolchain needed.  
⚠️ = Possible, but takes some more effort and/or special setups or VM to work.

Building can be done via:

```shell
cargo build --package <package>
```

Or run it directly (running will build the project beforehand!):

```shell
cargo run --package <package>
```

If there are tests present for the project, we can test them:

```shell
cargo test --package <package>
```

Or check if the project configuration is valid & build-able:

```shell
cargo check --package <package>
```

> Note: Adding `--release` to either of the commands will build a release version, instead of a debug version.

**Do note that some platforms (like iOS and Android) require special tools and `cargo` extensions to properly build.**  
While we could do that step manually, it is much more convenient and easier to use this way.
Check the `README.md` of a platform to learn more about requirements and tools.

Since we can't build for all target platforms on a single host platform (without major modification; see above), the `--package <package>` part is very important.
Simply replace `<package>` with the package name inside the `Cargo.toml` to build it.  
Names commonly will be `platform_<platform>` for platform-specific packages (e.g. `platform_windows` or `platform_ios`) or `shared` for the shared code.
In case multiple shared projects are present, check their `Cargo.toml` for their name (commonly: folder name).

However, since we share most of our code on all target platforms, we only really need to validate the code working on **one platform** (ideally your host platform for best performance or main target platform).
Only rarely should we need platform-specific code which, if it exists, needs to be tested.
Though, a continuous integration pipeline (CI) can take care of that for you mostly!  
Check [Continuous Integration](#Continuous-Integration) for more.

## Continuous Integration

This project utilizes the GitHub Actions CI (= Continuous Integration) to showcase how to build for all platforms.  
For most platforms we just need a runner on the target platform (Windows, Linux or macOS) and install Rust.  
This can be simply done by following [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) (check the [other install options](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html) for automatically installing inside an CI).  
Something like:

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable --profile full -y
```

should work for most platforms.

Note that we _may_ need more tools installed depending on the CI provider and platform.  
Check the host <-> target matrix at [Building & Running](#Building-&-Running)

Additionally, often we have to `source` the profile changes. Something like:

```shell
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Additionally we have templates for other CI platforms.  
Please note that some platforms are just a basic example on how to build part of this project, e.g. building only the `platform_linux` package.  
This is done to save on build costs/minutes.

> Please note, that if just one CI platform is failing, it is most likely linked to a plan or build credit issue on said platform.  
> GitHub Actions is **NOT** limited for open source repositories.  
> If GitHub Actions succeed, all other CI platforms _should_ succeed as well.

### CI Platform: GitHub Actions

On GitHub Actions we have a workflow file per package (platforms & shared).  
Each hast their own badge.

### CI Platform: CircleCI

On CircleCI we also support each package, but we only have one badge for the whole pipeline.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template/tree/main)

> Note that a failure here can also mean we run out of credits. Happens too often unfortunately!

### CI Platform: Travis

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/rust-multiplatform/Base-Project-Template)

On Travis we only build for Windows, macOS and Linux.  
Android and iOS _would_ be possible, however it requires a lot more work.
The Android SDK and iOS SDK must be installed, xcode tool, cross compilers, etc.

Additionally, we want to save on build credits here.

> Note a failure or unknown status may be linked to used up credits and/or plan.

### CI Platform: GitLab CI

To use GitLab CI we mirror our repository from GitHub to GitLab.

Currently, we are only building `platform_linux`. Other platforms should be possible.

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/rust-multiplatform/base-project-template/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/rust-multiplatform/base-project-template/-/commits/main)

### CI Platform: BitBucket Pipeline

Unfortunately, BitBucket Pipelines don't have status badges.

The pipelines are available at: [BitBucket Mirror](https://bitbucket.org/rust-multiplatform/base-project-template/)

### CI Platform: TeamCity

[![Build Status](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/app/rest/builds/project:(id:OpenSourceProjects_RustMultiplatform_BaseProjectTemplate)/statusIcon)](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?projectId=projectId=OpenSourceProjects_RustMultiplatform_BaseProjectTemplate)

To use [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) you either have to host your own Server, subscribe for a hosted (TeamCity Cloud) server or apply for your [OSS project being added for free](https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2016/10/hosted-teamcity-for-open-source-a-new-home/).

Unfortunately, TeamCity depends highly on hosted Agents and for OSS only Linux (ubuntu) is available.
Our pipeline only builds the `platform_linux` package (and internally `shared`).
Building other platforms is possible (Windows: Cross-Compilation with MinGW, WebAssembly & Android: "Natively" supported), but requires a more complicated setup.

Furthermore, the platforms macOS and iOS can't be build without having your own Agent running on a Mac.
There is the [Docker-OSX](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX) project which makes it possible to run macOS under Docker. Hard to setup and requires a lot of resources for "just building" an app.

Windows builds would also be much easier if we'd have an agent for it.
