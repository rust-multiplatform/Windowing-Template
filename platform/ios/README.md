# Platform: iOS

This is the platform-specific project for the platform iOS.  
Make sure to check the shared crate as we depend on it.

## How does this work?

Rust is a cross-platform language that supports many different architectures and platforms.  
Building for Desktop Platforms (like Windows, Linux, macOS) is natively supported as long as the required tools are installed.
For Android, iOS and WebAssembly (WASM) we _"require"_ some additional tools to build.
In essence, we could do it without those tools but it would be much harder to do so.
Said tools commonly package our apps into .APK, .APP and .JS/WASM, link them against our library and make sure the entrypoint is called.

Inside `src/lib.rs` we have a public entrypoint defined:

```rust
pub fn entrypoint() {
    // Our cross-platform code here
}
```

Each platform calls this, while each platform itself has an entrypoint.  

Ideally, we **only** have our shared code.  
However, sometimes we need some very platform specific things that can only be done on said platform.
In this case we have _some_ non-shared/platform-specific code but overall this should only be true for very special cases as the Rust standard library works mostly the same on each platform/target.

## What does this crate do?

For iOS there we can't use the standard Rust Binary-Entrypoint.  
Instead, we have to define an external function in C-Standard called `main_rs`.  
That is our `main` function that will be called from iOS:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main_rs() {
    // OUR CODE HERE
}
```

Check out the shared crate for more on how this is working and what it is doing.

This is the most basic of examples: A simple `"Hello World"` or better yet: `"Hello from Rust!"` to the standard output.  
On Desktop platforms this will open a Terminal/Console printing out the text and exiting.  
For Android, iOS and WebAssembly this will be logged to LogCat, Device Logs and the Browser Console respectively.  

**Independent of the platform the app will _exit_ right after being done. Depending on the platform the window (console _or_ app) may close before you even see it.**  
On Desktop you can call the executable from a terminal either by using the executable in `target/(debug|release|<arch>)/platform_*(.exe)` or using the `cargo run --package platform_<platform>` command.
For Android, iOS and WebAssembly enable persistent logging and reopen the app/website.

✅ = Natively supported.  
🔀 = Cross-Compilation & Toolchain needed.  
⚠️ = Possible, but takes some more effort and/or special setups or VM to work.

Requirements:  

- Rust and Cargo is installed, preferably via [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Use the stable channel ideally.
- XCode and Clang is required. Either download XCode from the AppStore (or from an Archive for older macOS version) or install `clang` and `xcode-buildtools` via [Brew](https://brew.sh).
- Install [Cargo-XCodeBuild](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-xcodebuild): `cargo install cargo-xcodebuild`.

To build we have to change two fields in the `Cargo.toml`:  
`device_id` and `device_type`.  
The `device_id` must be filled with a **valid** Device-ID.  
_For some reason the placeholders like `iphonesimulator:...:iphonesimulator` don't work._  
You can run `xcrun simctl list devices available ios` inside a terminal to get a list of simulated and actual devices.  
Secondly, `device_type` must be either `simulator` or `device`, depending on if you are using a simulator or actual device.  
In CI's we do the following to auto-select a fitting simulator:  

```shell
DEVICE_ID=$(xcrun simctl list devices available --json ios | jq '.devices | to_entries | map(select(.key | match(".*iOS.*"))) | map(.value)[0][0].udid'); cat platform/ios/Cargo.toml | sed "s/device_id = .*/device_id = $DEVICE_ID/g" | tee platform/ios/Cargo.toml
```

Debug/Development Build:

```shell
cargo xcodebuild build --package platform_ios
```

Release/Production Build:

```shell
cargo xcodebuild build --package platform_ios --release
```

> Optionally add `--verbose` to see what is happening.  
> Floods your console with message though possibly, use when there are build errors.

## Testing

Requirements:  

- Rust and Cargo is installed, preferably via [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Use the stable channel ideally.
- XCode and Clang is required. Either download XCode from the AppStore (or from an Archive for older macOS version) or install `clang` and `xcode-buildtools` via [Brew](https://brew.sh).
- Install [Cargo-XCodeBuild](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-xcodebuild): `cargo install cargo-xcodebuild`.
- Either an iOS Device in Developer mode or a Simulator (-> XCode).

> Note: Testing on iOS is possible but much more complex.  
> Your tests may work, but may also break.  
> Testing requires the app to be run on an iOS System (emulated or real), check the [Building section](#building) above for more information.  
> Get builds working first before you attempt to test or run!

Debug/Development Testing:

```shell
cargo xcodebuild test --package platform_ios
```

Release/Production Testing:

```shell
cargo xcodebuild test --package platform_ios --release
```

> Optionally add `--verbose` to see what is happening.  
> Floods your console with message though possibly, use when there are build errors.
